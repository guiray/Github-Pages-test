# Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting plain text documents. It's designed to be easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for creating web content, documentation, and even blog posts.

## Why Use Markdown?

1. **Simplicity:** Markdown uses simple and intuitive syntax. You don't need to be a coding expert to use it.

2. **Portability:** Markdown documents can be easily converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats.

3. **Widely Supported:** Many platforms and tools, including GitHub, support Markdown.

## Basic Markdown Syntax

Here are some basic Markdown elements:

- **Headers:** Use `#` for headings, e.g., `# Heading 1`.

- **Lists:** Create ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

- **Links:** `[Text](URL)` creates clickable links.

- **Images:** `![Alt Text](Image URL)` embeds images.

- **Emphasis:** Use `*italic*` or `**bold**` for text styling.

- **Code:** Inline code with \`backticks\`, and code blocks with triple backticks:

   ```python
   def hello_world():
       print("Hello, World!")
